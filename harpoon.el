;;; Commentary:

;; This package is an emacs port of the neovim plugin "harpoon" written by ThePrimeagen.
;; You can easily link files to a given hotkey and then jump your buffer to that file
;; with that hotkey.  Files can be hotswapped easily.

;;
;; Use Bind keys for harpoon-open-entry harpoon-add-file-or-buffer called with a number argument.
;; Then you can add files with that command, and then jump to them immediately.
